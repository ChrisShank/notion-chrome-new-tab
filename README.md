# notion-chrome-new-tab

A simple Chrome extension that opens up Notion.so when you open a new tab in chrome.

## How it works

Its uses Javascript to simply redirect the page to (https://notion.so)[https://notion.so]

## Future implementations

Look into registering a background script for the extension and listen to when a 'onCreated' event is fired. (reference)[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#event-onCreated]
